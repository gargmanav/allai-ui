# AllAI Property Management Platform

## Overview
AllAI Property is a comprehensive platform for part-time landlords and small property management companies. It enables users to track properties, manage tenants, monitor maintenance, handle expenses, and stay organized with automated reminders. The platform supports various user types including platform super admins, organization admins (landlords), property owners, contractors, and tenants, each with role-based access control. Its goal is to provide an intuitive interface for managing real estate portfolios, including features like ownership entity management, smart case tracking, and automated regulatory compliance.

## Recent Changes
- **January 15, 2026**: Implemented proposal comparison and counter-proposal system for landlord-contractor negotiations. Landlords can now view side-by-side comparison of multiple contractor quotes on work orders (price, availability, scope, line items) in a dedicated "Proposals" tab. Full negotiation workflow: landlords accept/decline/counter proposals with modified terms; contractors see pending counter-proposals on their dashboard and can accept/decline/re-counter. Auto-management of competing proposals - accepting one quote automatically declines others and updates case status to "In Progress". Added `quoteCounterProposals` table tracking counter-proposal lifecycle with status enum (pending/accepted/rejected). API routes: GET/POST `/api/landlord/cases/:caseId/quotes`, `/api/landlord/quotes/:quoteId/accept|decline|counter`, and `/api/contractor/quotes/pending-counter-proposals` with accept/decline/re-counter actions. Defensive UI filtering ensures only quotes with actual pending entries render.
- **November 16, 2025**: Implemented organization impersonation feature for superadmin. Superadmins can now click "View Screens" in Organizations tab to impersonate an org and navigate through their dashboard, properties, maintenance, and calendar pages as if they were an org admin. Impersonation is session-based using `req.session.viewAsOrgId` which overrides `req.user.orgId` during impersonation. Added impersonation banner component shown on all major pages when impersonating, with "Return to Superadmin" button to exit. Created `/api/admin/impersonate/:orgId` and `/api/admin/stop-impersonation` endpoints. Updated `requireAuth` middleware to support impersonation by setting `effectiveOrgId` and `viewAsOrgId` fields. All data scoping automatically respects impersonation through existing `req.user.orgId` checks in routes and scoping helpers (`scopePropertiesByRole`, `scopeCasesByRole`).
- **November 16, 2025**: Redesigned superadmin dashboard with comprehensive analytics and tabbed interface. Created 4-tab interface: Overview (platform stats, user distribution by role), User Analytics (all users with role/activity filtering, login tracking), Contractor Marketplace (all contractors with job stats, marketplace status, favorites, specialties), and Organizations (all orgs with screen access). Enhanced `/api/admin/stats` to include activeUserCount (30-day window), created `/api/admin/contractors` endpoint with full marketplace analytics (job counts, favorites, activity status, specialties), and enhanced `/api/admin/users` to include daysSinceLogin and activityStatus (very_active/active/inactive/dormant/never_logged_in). Activity calculated from `updatedAt` timestamp with buckets: ≤7 days = very active, ≤30 days = active, ≤90 days = inactive, >90 days = dormant. Superadmin can now track platform-wide user engagement, contractor marketplace performance, and organizational activity from single unified dashboard.
- **November 15, 2025**: Removed simplified TenantDashboardNew.tsx and fixed tenant cases API. Deleted the new simplified tenant dashboard to eliminate confusion - only the original full-featured tenant dashboard (with Maya AI, photo uploads, appointments) remains at `/tenant-dashboard` route. Fixed GET `/api/tenant/cases` to query by `reporterUserId` for new cases with fallback to `unitId` for legacy cases (handles existing cases where reporterUserId=null). Fixed POST `/api/tenant/cases` to include all required domain fields (priority, category, aiTriageJson, reporterUserId) and added media upload handling to persist photos in `caseMedia` table. Frontend restored full payload submission and corrected endpoint to `/api/tenant/cases`.
- **November 15, 2025**: Completed quote system UX improvements and archive functionality. Implemented inline line item editing (edit in same table row with check/cancel buttons), changed quantity input step to 1 for whole number increments while retaining decimal support, added delete confirmation dialog, and implemented soft-delete archive system with `archivedAt` timestamp. All quote retrieval methods automatically filter out archived quotes using `isNull(quotes.archivedAt)`. DELETE endpoint now archives instead of permanently deleting, preserving data for auditing/recovery. Status badges (Draft/Sent/Approved/Declined) display on all quote cards.
- **November 15, 2025**: Replaced multi-step quote update with atomic backend transaction. Created `updateQuoteWithLineItems` storage method using `db.transaction()` for ACID guarantees on quote + line item updates. Frontend now makes single PATCH/POST request instead of complex DELETE/CREATE/rollback orchestration. Schema validation uses dedicated update schemas that omit immutable fields (contractorId, approvalToken, quoteId, id).
- **November 15, 2025**: Implemented Phase 1 of quote/invoice system for contractors. Created `quote_status` enum (draft/sent/approved/rejected/expired), `deposit_type` enum (none/percentage/fixed), `quotes` table (customer link, totals, tax, deposit, expiry), and `quote_line_items` table (description, quantity, rate, amount, display order). Added 9 storage methods for quote CRUD. Built 8 secure API routes at `/api/contractor/quotes` with customer ownership verification, quote ownership checks, line item membership validation, and explicit guards against quoteId reassignment. All routes use storage layer exclusively with proper tenant isolation. Backend passes security audit with zero cross-contractor vulnerabilities.
- **November 15, 2025**: Transformed contractor workflow to manual customer management. Contractors can now manually add, edit, and delete customers through the Customers page. Created `contractor_customers` table with fields for name, email, company, phone, and notes. Added `customerId` field to `smart_cases` table to link work orders to customers. Work order creation form includes customer dropdown (contractors only). Work order cards display customer names via `customerId` field. Customer filter in Job Hub filters by `customerId` rather than property ownership. API endpoints: GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE `/api/contractor/customers` with proper validation and ownership checks.
- **November 15, 2025**: Fixed critical timezone bug in calendar reminder filtering. Date-only reminders (e.g., "2025-11-17") now parse correctly as org timezone midnight instead of UTC midnight. Day boundaries computed in org timezone (America/New_York) ensure reminders appear on correct calendar dates for users in any browser timezone. Added null dueAt guard in filters to prevent runtime errors.
- **November 15, 2025**: Implemented role-based field gating in ReminderForm. Contractors now see simplified form without property/entity/unit fields, which are automatically omitted from submission. Fixed contractors endpoint error by adding early role check before organization lookup.
- **November 12, 2025**: Removed predictive maintenance feature from Work Orders page (formerly Maintenance page). Terminology changed from "Smart Cases" to "Work Orders" throughout the application. The Predictive Maintenance tab has been removed, and all related predictive insights functionality (equipment failure predictions, maintenance forecasting) has been excised to streamline the contractor-focused workflow.
